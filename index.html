 <h3><strong>Reaon Why I Joined The Program</strong></h3>
 <p>From a young age, I have always been fascinated with technology and its potential to revolutionize the world we live in. Throughout my life, I have always been on the lookout for ways to challenge myself in tech and continuously learn new skills. For over 2 years i have been trying to transition into tech but as a working mum, its has been very difficult. I decided to join this program because after listening to various testimonials and accomplishment of aluminis I believe that Alt School Africa is just the right place for me to begin this journey, its self paced learning program will give me the oppotunity to learn at my own pace but at a good pace. Also, its vibrant community of learners and alumni will both inspire and encourage me to archieve my goals.
